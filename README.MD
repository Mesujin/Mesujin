## Mesujin
Just an anonymous guy who good at math, as mathematician i can confirm that dealing with base-2 number is quite confusing instead of dealing with base-10 number. <br/>
Well, i'm not a real programmer, so i might not knowing the basic things in programing, but i might knowing the non-basic things instead >.< as what i have on my repository. <br/>

Anyway, i'm here just to share the source of "my stuff"..
